# spring_boot_mongodb_docker
Introduction
This project is a Spring Boot application that utilizes MongoDB as the database and can be deployed using Docker. The application provides a template for creating RESTful APIs with Spring Boot and interacting with a MongoDB database.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration of Spring Boot with MongoDB and Docker. It showcases the basic setup and configuration required to build a web application that persists data in a MongoDB database and can be easily containerized using Docker.

Technologies
The following technologies and frameworks are used in this project:

Java 8+
Spring Boot
MongoDB
Docker
Installation
To run this application locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd your-repository
Build the application using Maven:

shell
Copy code
mvn clean install
Start MongoDB service either by installing it locally or using Docker:

If you have MongoDB installed locally, make sure it is running on the default port (27017).

If you prefer using Docker, run the following command:

shell
Copy code
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
Run the Spring Boot application:

shell
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application should now be up and running on http://localhost:8080.

Usage
You can interact with the RESTful APIs exposed by the application using tools like cURL or Postman. Below are a few examples of the available endpoints:

GET /api/users: Retrieves all users from the MongoDB database.
GET /api/users/{id}: Retrieves a specific user by ID.
POST /api/users: Creates a new user.
PUT /api/users/{id}: Updates an existing user.
DELETE /api/users/{id}: Deletes a user.
Make sure to replace {id} with the actual ID of a user when making requests to the API.
